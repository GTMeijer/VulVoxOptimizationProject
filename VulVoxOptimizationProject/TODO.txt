	2.: Or even better, one buffer: end of https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/04_Vertex_buffers/03_Index_buffer.html

2. transfer queue family (optional):
https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/04_Vertex_buffers/02_Staging_buffer.html#_transfer_queue

3. optimize buffer transfers (if needed):
We could use a fence and wait with vkWaitForFences, or simply wait for the transfer queue to become idle with vkQueueWaitIdle. A fence would allow you to schedule multiple transfers simultaneously and wait for all of them complete, instead of executing one at a time. That may give the driver more opportunities to optimize.

4. simultaneous buffers (end of https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/06_Texture_mapping/00_Images.html#_transition_barrier_masks)
