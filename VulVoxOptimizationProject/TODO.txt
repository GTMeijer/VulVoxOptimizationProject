1 transfer queue family (optional):

2, optimize buffer transfers (if needed):
We could use a fence and wait with vkWaitForFences, or simply wait for the transfer queue to become idle with vkQueueWaitIdle. A fence would allow you to schedule multiple transfers simultaneously and wait for all of them complete, instead of executing one at a time. That may give the driver more opportunities to optimize.
